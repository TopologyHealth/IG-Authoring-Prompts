## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Customize the prompts** by replacing the bracketed text with your specific details
2. **Provide context** about your IG component, audience, and goals
3. **Ask follow-up questions** to dive deeper into specific content areas
4. **Save successful prompts** for future use and share them with the community
5. **Iterate and refine** prompts based on the responses you receive

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Narrative Content

### Three Core Prompting Principles (Based on Real-World Experience)

1. **Be Descriptive** - Clearly explain what you want and include examples when possible
2. **Be Specific** - Focus the LLM on a tightly scoped task, avoid vague requests
3. **Break It Down** - Divide complex content creation into smaller, manageable sections

### LLM Integration Strategies

- **Start with content outlines** and build detail iteratively
- **Use the same LLM consistently** for related content to maintain style consistency
- **Provide examples** of the writing style and tone you want
- **Validate LLM outputs** against FHIR specifications and your IG requirements
