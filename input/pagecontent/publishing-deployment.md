## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Customize the prompts** by replacing the bracketed text with your specific details
2. **Provide context** about your IG components, publication goals, and deployment requirements
3. **Ask follow-up questions** to dive deeper into specific publication areas
4. **Save successful prompts** for future use and share them with the community
5. **Iterate and refine** prompts based on the responses you receive

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Publishing

### Three Core Prompting Principles (Based on Real-World Experience)

1. **Be Descriptive** - Clearly explain what you want to publish and include examples when possible
2. **Be Specific** - Focus the LLM on specific publication tasks, avoid vague requests
3. **Break It Down** - Divide complex publication into smaller, manageable steps

### LLM Integration Strategies

- **Start with simple publication tasks** and build complexity iteratively
- **Use the same LLM consistently** for related publication tasks to maintain context
- **Provide examples** of publication results you want to achieve
- **Validate LLM outputs** against FHIR specifications and your publication standards
