## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Customize the prompts** by replacing the bracketed text with your specific details
2. **Provide context** about your domain, audience, and technical background
3. **Ask follow-up questions** to dive deeper into specific areas
4. **Save successful prompts** for future use and share them with the community
5. **Iterate and refine** prompts based on the responses you receive

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Getting Started

### Role Assumption

Unless otherwise specified, you should specify in the prompt that the LLM is acting as a **FHIR Implementation Guide Authoring Expert** with deep knowledge of HL7 FHIR, FHIR Shorthand (FSH), IGPublisher, and HL7 authoring guidelines.

### Three Core Prompting Principles (Based on Real-World Experience)

1. **Be Descriptive** - Clearly explain what you want and include examples when possible
2. **Be Specific** - Focus the LLM on a tightly scoped task, avoid vague requests
3. **Break It Down** - Divide complex goals into smaller, manageable steps

### LLM Integration Strategies

- **Start with simple prompts** and build complexity iteratively
- **Use the same LLM consistently** for related tasks to maintain context
- **Provide examples** of what you want to achieve
- **Validate LLM outputs** against FHIR specifications and best practices
