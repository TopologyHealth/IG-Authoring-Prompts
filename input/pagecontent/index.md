## FHIR IG Prompt Library

Welcome to the FHIR Implementation Guide Prompt Library! This resource provides curated prompts and guidance to help you author high-quality FHIR Implementation Guides using LLMs.

### üéØ Purpose

This IG contains practical prompts and templates that you can use with AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help with various aspects of FHIR IG development. Each prompt is designed to be copy-paste ready and tailored for specific IG authoring tasks like:

- Profile and extension creation in FHIR Shorthand (FSH)
- Value set design and binding strategies
- Example generation and validation workflows

### üé• FHIR DevDays 2025 Presentation

This guide was created based on the content from Alex Goel's FHIR DevDays 2025 Presentation **LLMs for jurisdictional FHIR IG authorship**:

Authoring FHIR Implementation Guides is complex and time-consuming. Alex shows how LLMs can streamline IG development, profile generation, and harmonization efforts, using real-world healthcare implementation as a case study.

He walks through building a AI tools and techniques for FHIR IG development and offers practical tips to avoid common pitfalls‚Äîespecially validation errors.

### üöÄ Quick Reference

Here's a quick "Do & Don't" reference for effective prompt writing:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about your FHIR task | Use vague or generic requests |
| Provide context (e.g., IG name, resource type) | Omit important details |
| Ask for step-by-step or structured output | Rely on open-ended prompts |
| Reference FHIR version or profiles if needed | Assume the AI knows your context |

### New to FHIR IGs?

A **FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)** is a set of rules, examples, and documentation that shows how FHIR should be used for a specific use case or community. IGs define profiles, extensions, value sets, and implementation requirements, and are essential for interoperability.

#### Contribution Guidelines

- Keep prompts **concise and actionable**
- Include **context** about when to use each prompt
- Provide **examples** where helpful
- Test prompts before submitting

#### Key Takeaways from Real-World Implementation

- **LLMs helped harmonize multiple IGs** into unified standards across different domains
- **Detailed prompts = better outputs** - the three core principles work in practice
- **LLMs excel at FSH generation and applying rule sets** (less so at creating them)
- **Human expertise remains crucial** for debugging complex FSH errors
- **Surprisingly good at generating ValueSets and FQL tables** from structured data
