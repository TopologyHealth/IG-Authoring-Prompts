### Profile Invariant Creation

```plaintext
You are a FHIR Profile Authoring Specialist with expertise in FHIRPath/XPath and invariant authoring in FHIR Shorthand (FSH). Ensure outputs meet [FHIR R4/R5] conformance and pass `sushi` and IGPublisher validation without errors.

I need to define an invariant for my [resource type] profile to enforce this business rule:
"[state the rule in plain language, e.g., Either Patient.name.given and/or Patient.name.family SHALL be present.]"

Please provide:
1. A precise **FHIRPath** expression implementing the rule.
2. A corresponding **XPath** expression.
3. A complete **FSH invariant** snippet with: `Invariant: [id]`, `Description`, `* severity = #[error|warning]`, `* expression = "[...]"`, `* xpath = "[...]"`.
4. The **FSH usage** showing how to apply the invariant with `* obeys [id]` at the correct element path (root vs. specific element) and any required `^constraint` metadata if applicable.
5. A minimal **test instance** outline (JSON) that should **pass**, and one that should **fail**, with a one-line explanation for each.
6. Notes on edge cases and how the invariant interacts with cardinality, bindings, and slicing (if relevant).

Context:
- Resource/Profile: [name]
- Element scope for invariant (root or element path): [e.g., Patient.name]
- Severity: [#error or #warning]
- Related constraints or slices: [list]

Example (for reference only; do not copy blindly):
Plain rule: "Either Patient.name.given and/or Patient.name.family SHALL be present."
FHIRPath: `(family.exists() or given.exists())`
XPath: `(/f:name/f:family or /f:name/f:given)`
FSH:
Invariant: ca-core-pat-1
Description: "Either Patient.name.given and/or Patient.name.family SHALL be present."
* severity = #error
* expression = "(family.exists() or given.exists())"
* xpath = "(/f:name/f:family or /f:name/f:given)"
Usage:
* name obeys ca-core-pat-1
```

## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start with scope definition** to ensure your profile meets actual needs
2. **Consider your audience** - technical vs. clinical implementers have different needs
3. **Balance constraints** - too many constraints limit flexibility, too few reduce interoperability
4. **Document everything** - clear documentation is crucial for adoption
5. **Test thoroughly** - validation catches many issues before they become problems

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Profile Creation

### FSH Development with LLMs

- **Break down complex profiles** into smaller, focused prompts
- **Use LLMs for repetitive tasks** like RuleSet application across multiple profiles
- **Validate LLM-generated FSH** with SUSHI before committing
- **Provide existing FSH examples** to improve LLM output quality

### Common LLM Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't ask for complete profiles** in one prompt - break them down
- **Always validate FSH syntax** - LLMs can make syntax errors
- **Provide context** about your IG and existing profiles
- **Use iterative prompting** for complex profile structures
