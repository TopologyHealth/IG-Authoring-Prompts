## Prompt Templates

This section provides reusable templates and guidelines for creating effective prompts for FHIR IG authoring. Use these templates as a starting point and customize them for your specific needs.

### üöÄ Three Core Prompting Principles (Based on Real-World Experience)

#### 1. Be Descriptive

- **Clearly explain what you want** and include examples when possible
- **Provide context** about your domain, audience, and requirements
- **Include relevant details** about your current situation and constraints

#### 2. Be Specific

- **Focus the LLM on a tightly scoped task** - avoid vague requests
- **Break large tasks into smaller, focused prompts**
- **Specify which IG, spec, and context to follow**
- **Include your goals and quality criteria**

#### 3. Break It Down

- **Divide complex goals into smaller, manageable steps**
- **Use iterative prompting** for complex tasks
- **Build on previous successful prompts**
- **Ask for step-by-step guidance rather than complete solutions**
