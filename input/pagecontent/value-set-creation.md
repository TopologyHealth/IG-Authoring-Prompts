### üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start with scope definition** to ensure your value set meets actual needs  
2. **Consider your audience** - technical vs. clinical implementers have different terminology needs  
3. **Balance comprehensiveness** - too many codes can overwhelm, too few may not cover needs  
4. **Document everything** - clear documentation is crucial for adoption  
5. **Test thoroughly** - validation catches many issues before they become problems
