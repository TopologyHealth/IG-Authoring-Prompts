## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Start with scope definition** to ensure your extension meets actual needs
2. **Consider the context carefully** - extensions should be placed where they make sense
3. **Keep extensions focused** - one extension should serve one clear purpose
4. **Document everything** - clear documentation is crucial for adoption
5. **Test thoroughly** - validation catches many issues before they become problems

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Extension Development

### Extension Generation with LLMs

- **Provide existing extension examples** to improve LLM output quality
- **Use LLMs for repetitive extension patterns** across multiple resources
- **Validate extension context** - LLMs can suggest inappropriate placement
- **Test extension integration** with profiles to ensure proper usage

### LLM-Assisted Extension Workflows

- **Generate extension structure** with LLMs, then refine manually
- **Use LLMs for extension documentation** and examples
- **Validate extension constraints** against FHIR best practices
- **Iterate on extension design** using LLM feedback
