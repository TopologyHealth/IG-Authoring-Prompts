## üí° Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Customize the prompts** by replacing the bracketed text with your specific details
2. **Provide context** about your IG components, validation tools, and quality goals
3. **Ask follow-up questions** to dive deeper into specific validation areas
4. **Save successful prompts** for future use and share them with the community
5. **Iterate and refine** prompts based on the responses you receive

## ü§ñ LLM-Specific Tips for Validation

### Three Core Prompting Principles (Based on Real-World Experience)

1. **Be Descriptive** - Clearly explain what you want to validate and include examples when possible
2. **Be Specific** - Focus the LLM on specific validation tasks, avoid vague requests
3. **Break It Down** - Divide complex validation into smaller, manageable tasks

### LLM Integration Strategies

- **Start with simple validation tasks** and build complexity iteratively
- **Use the same LLM consistently** for related validation tasks to maintain context
- **Provide examples** of validation results you want to achieve
- **Validate LLM outputs** against FHIR specifications and your quality standards
