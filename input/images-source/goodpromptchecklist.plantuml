title Good Prompting Checklist for FHIR IG Work

{+
 "Context & Scope" |
 [ ] State IG, resource, and FHIR version
 [ ] Describe audience & concrete use case
 [ ] Attach examples (SD/FSH, bindings, ValueSets)
 [ ] Avoid vague asks (e.g., "Write an Observation profile")
 --
 "Structure the Request" |
 [ ] Break complex tasks into small steps
 [ ] Ask for structured output (FSH blocks, tables, bullets)
 [ ] Provide inputs (gap analysis, spreadsheets, SDs)
 [ ] Avoid one giant prompt with multiple goals
 --
 "Terminology & Constraints" |
 [ ] Name code systems & binding strength (e.g., SNOMED CT)
 [ ] Link to existing profiles/extensions to reuse
 [ ] Prevent invented codes or bindings
 --
 "Example Generation" |
 [ ] Provide demographics + condition + related resources (episode of care)
 [ ] Supply StructureDefinitions so extensions appear correctly
 [ ] Include at least one coded Medication example with real codes
 --
 "Editing at Scale" |
 [ ] Use AI-enabled IDEs (e.g., Cursor) for repetitive changes
 [ ] Prefer RuleSets; insert references consistently
 [ ] Check syntax like "* insert MyRuleSet" across files
 --
 "Validation & Troubleshooting" |
 [ ] Run SUSHI and IG Publisher on every iteration
 [ ] Fix errors iteratively; keep diffs small
 [ ] Ask community (chat.fhir.org) for tricky validation issues
 --
 "FQL & Edge Cases" |
 [ ] Provide strong context and a known-good example when asking for FQL
 [ ] Test outputsâ€”expect occasional gaps due to limited training data
 --
 "Reproducibility" |
 [ ] Save prompts/templates in the repo (version control)
 [ ] Record model name & key settings when sharing prompts
