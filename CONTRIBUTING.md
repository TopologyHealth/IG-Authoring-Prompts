# Contributing to FHIR IG Prompt Library

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FHIR IG Prompt Library! This document provides guidelines for adding new prompts and improving existing ones.

## üéØ What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions that help FHIR IG authors with:

- **Practical prompts** that can be copy-pasted and used immediately
- **Clear guidance** on when and how to use each prompt
- **Real-world examples** from actual IG development experience
- **Best practices** and tips for effective prompt engineering
- **Troubleshooting help** for common IG development challenges

## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Prompts

#### Choose the Right Category
- **Getting Started**: For beginners and project setup
- **Profile Creation**: For profile design and development
- **Extension Definition**: For custom extensions
- **Value Set Creation**: For terminology management
- **Narrative Content**: For documentation and examples
- **Validation & Testing**: For quality assurance
- **Publishing & Deployment**: For IG publication
- **Troubleshooting**: For problem resolution
- **LLM Integration**: For LLM-assisted IG development workflows

#### Follow the Prompt Structure
Each prompt should follow this basic structure:

```
[Brief description of what the prompt helps with]

[The actual prompt text that users can copy-paste]

[Optional: Additional context or tips]
```

#### Example Contribution
```markdown
### Profile Constraint Planning
Use this prompt when you need to define appropriate constraints for your FHIR profile elements.

```
I need to define constraints for my [resource type] profile. 
I want to ensure [describe your constraint goals] while maintaining flexibility.

Please help me:
1. Set appropriate minimum and maximum cardinality
2. Define value set bindings for coded elements
3. Set length and pattern constraints for string elements
4. Define reference constraints for related resources
5. Balance constraint vs. flexibility appropriately

My profile will be used by [describe your audience] for [describe your use case].
```

**Tip**: Be specific about your constraint goals and consider your audience's technical level.
```

### 2. Improving Existing Prompts

- **Clarify unclear language** or add missing context
- **Add practical examples** or use cases
- **Include troubleshooting tips** or common pitfalls
- **Update outdated information** or add new best practices
- **Improve formatting** or organization

### 3. Adding New Categories

If you have prompts that don't fit existing categories:

1. **Create a new page** in the `input/pagecontent/` directory
2. **Update the SUSHI config** to include the new page
3. **Update the navigation menu** to include the new category
4. **Add cross-references** from related categories

## üîß Technical Requirements

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `value-set-creation.md`)
- Keep names descriptive and consistent with existing files

### Markdown Formatting
- Use standard Markdown syntax
- Include emojis for visual organization (üéØ, üîß, üìù, etc.)
- Use consistent heading levels (## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Include proper links between related pages

### SUSHI Configuration
- Add new pages to `sushi-config.yaml` under the `pages` section
- Update the `menu` section to include navigation links
- Ensure page titles are descriptive and user-friendly

## üìã Quality Guidelines

### Prompt Quality Standards
1. **Be specific and actionable** - prompts should give clear guidance
2. **Include relevant context** - help users understand when to use each prompt
3. **Provide examples** - show how to customize prompts for different scenarios
4. **Follow FHIR best practices** - ensure guidance aligns with FHIR standards
5. **Test your prompts** - verify they work well with AI assistants
6. **Follow the three core principles** - Be Descriptive, Be Specific, Break It Down

### Content Organization
1. **Group related prompts** logically within each category
2. **Use consistent formatting** across all prompt pages
3. **Include cross-references** to related topics
4. **Provide navigation** between related concepts
5. **Maintain clear hierarchy** in information structure

## üìö Prompt Writing Tips

### Effective Prompt Design
1. **Start with context** - help the AI understand your situation

- **Implementation**: "I need help implementing [feature] for [use case]"
